# Lisa's Learning Routine on Transformer for solving the Inverse Problem for PDE

1. Start from the traditional transformer from the YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts&t=3685s&pp=ygUQdHJhbnNmb3JtZXIgY29kZQ%3D%3D, the related file is transformerStructureStepbyStep.py

2. Transform the step-by-step instruction code into the 2D case in the TransformerModified file.

3. Using the generated synthetic data for neural operators from the repository synthetic-data-for-neural-operators file.

   What is Drawing synthetic representative functions from a Sobolev space?

     1. What is the Sobolev space?
        Sobolev空间是通过完备化的过程得到的. 把有理数中一些集合的极限也加到集合中，就相当于填补了集合中的那些洞。
